# Python-Coffee-Shop
# â˜• Siddhu Coffee Ordering System

A simple interactive coffee ordering system built using Python. This project demonstrates basic user input handling, conditional logic, and dynamic pricing based on customer choices. 

The program welcomes customers, takes their names, checks if they are "evil" (for a fun twist), lets them order from a menu, calculates the total price, and prints a receipt.

## Features
âœ… Interactive name-based greeting  
âœ… Checks for "evil" customers (fun logic)  
âœ… Dynamic menu with different coffee options  
âœ… Custom pricing for whipped cream in lattes  
âœ… Calculates total bill based on quantity ordered  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Basic Input/Output handling
- Conditional Statements (`if-else`)
